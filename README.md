## Overview

The **VIRTUOSO SDK (VSDK)** is a Unity-based XR software
development kit that enables developers to build XR experiences with naturalistic user interactions *faster* while including support for a variety of XR devices and peripherals, from HMDs to hand tracking and haptics. VSDK is completely free and open-source under the MIT License and
is based on VRTK ([http://vrtk.io](http://vrtk.io/)).

Here are some of the features that make VSDK unique:

- Hand Tracking for interactions—VSDK supports Leap Motion, 
ManusVR, Sense Glove, and other systems so users can 
interact with virtual environments with their own hands

- Haptic Feedback—physics-based and pattern-driven haptic feedback with support for devices as simple as controllers
or as extensive as the bHaptics TactSuit.

- Rapid prototyping through the Reaction System—extensible,
event driven behavior based on naturalistic interactions
